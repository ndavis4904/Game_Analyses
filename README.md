# Game Analyses


The purpose of this repository is to run analysis on games that are commonly played in my house to determine trends, strategy, and length of time that should be planned to devote to these games. The games include the following:

* Ticket to Ride
* Lord of the Rings: Trading Card Game
* Chutes and Ladders
